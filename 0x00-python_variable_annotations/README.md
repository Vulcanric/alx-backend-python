# 0x00. Python - Variable Annotations
Python is a dynamically-typed language. Which means that variable types are dynamically set at run-time, upon assignment of a value to a variable.

# So why Type Annotations in Python
Python is still a dynamically-typed language, but type annotating Python, provides the following benfits:
- Code documentation: Using type annotations, a developer reading type-annotated code (his own or someone elseâ€™s) will know exactly what type each variables is supposed to be. This helps reduce bugs and exceptions and accelerate the development cycle.
- Linting and validation: code editors and continuous integration (CI) pipelines can be configured to automatically validate type-annotated code at build-time and catch bugs before they make it to production.
