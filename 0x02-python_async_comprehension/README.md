# 0x02. Python - Async Comprehension
**`Python`**   **`Back-end`**
---
As continuation to the last project, this project aims to extend understanding more on Asynchronous Programming in Python. This is achieved, working with the asynchronous versions of Python Data Structures (List, Set, Dict, etc) and Generators using `async/await`.
Also implemented Typing annotations for generators `Generator[YieldType, SendType, ReturnType]`
